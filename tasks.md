## In Progress

- [ ] Add more specialized agent types (beyond chat, web surfer, file surfer)
- [ ] Implement memory module for agents to store and retrieve context
- [ ] Create visualization for workflow execution in Chainlit UI
- [ ] Add metrics collection and dashboard

## Planned

- [ ] Implement persistent storage for ledgers (currently in-memory)
- [ ] Add user feedback loop in workflow execution
- [ ] Create configuration system with environment variables
- [ ] Add support for external tool integrations
- [ ] Implement agent communication protocol
- [ ] Add workflow templates for common tasks
- [ ] Create testing framework for agents and workflows
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Add support for multi-user environments
- [ ] Optimize performance for large workflows
- [ ] Add support for parallel task execution

## Code Structure Improvements (Refactoring)

- [x] Consolidate helper scripts into a `scripts/` directory
- [x] Relocate tests from `src/agentic_kernel/tests/` to top-level `tests/`
- [ ] Refactor large files (`src/agentic_kernel/app.py`, `src/agentic_kernel/orchestrator.py`) into smaller modules
- [ ] Clarify primary application entry points and document usage
- [ ] Resolve naming ambiguities (`config.py` vs `config/`, `ledgers.py` vs `ledgers/`)
- [ ] Review `setup.py` for redundancy with `pyproject.toml` and `uv`

## Orchestrator Enhancements

- [x] Implement nested loop architecture (planning and execution loops)
- [x] Add dynamic workflow creation from natural language goals
- [x] Implement workflow state management and progress tracking
- [x] Add error recovery and replanning capabilities
- [x] Create agent registration system
- [x] Implement task delegation strategy
- [ ] Add intelligent agent selection based on task requirements
- [ ] Implement workflow versioning and history
- [ ] Add support for conditional branches in workflows
- [ ] Create workflow optimization strategies
- [ ] Implement workflow templates and reusable components
- [ ] Add support for human-in-the-loop approvals
- [ ] Create plugin system for extending orchestrator capabilities
