# Agentic Kernel Architecture

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the Agentic Kernel architecture, focusing on the components, interaction patterns, and workflow execution mechanisms.

## System Overview

Agentic Kernel is a multi-agent framework designed to enable complex task execution through specialized agents that work together in an orchestrated workflow. The architecture follows a modular design that separates concerns between agent capabilities, task management, and workflow orchestration.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent System

The Agent System is the central registry for all available agents in the system:

- **BaseAgent**: Abstract base class that all agents implement
- **AgentConfig**: Configuration structure for agent initialization
- **AgentSystem**: Central registry class for managing agent instances
- **Agent Registration**: Dynamic registration mechanism to make agents available to the orchestrator

### 2. Task Management

The task management system tracks the state of tasks and provides a persistent ledger:

- **Task**: Data structure representing a unit of work
- **TaskLedger**: Persistent store for task information and results
- **TaskManager**: Interface for creating, updating, and tracking tasks
- **Task Dependencies**: Mechanism for expressing relationships between tasks

### 3. Ledgers

Ledgers provide persistent storage and tracking for various system aspects:

- **TaskLedger**: Records tasks, their status, and results
- **ProgressLedger**: Tracks workflow execution progress
- **Message History**: Maintains agent communication records

## Orchestrator Agent

The Orchestrator Agent is the core component responsible for workflow planning, execution, and monitoring. It implements a sophisticated nested loop architecture for adaptive task execution.

### Dynamic Planning Process

The Orchestrator uses a multi-stage planning process:

1. **Goal Analysis**: Analyzing the high-level goal to identify required subtasks
2. **Task Decomposition**: Breaking down complex goals into manageable steps
3. **Plan Creation**: Organizing steps into a coherent execution plan
4. **Agent Assignment**: Matching tasks to agents based on capabilities
5. **Plan Revision**: Dynamically updating the plan based on execution results

### Nested Loop Architecture

The Orchestrator implements two nested control loops:

#### Outer Loop (Planning Loop)

The Outer Loop is responsible for:
- Managing the TaskLedger
- Creating and revising workflow plans
- Initiating planning attempts (up to a configurable maximum)
- Resetting agent states during replanning
- Evaluating overall workflow success

Implementation logic:
```python
# Pseudo-code for the outer loop
planning_attempts = 0
while planning_attempts < max_planning_attempts:
    planning_attempts += 1
    
    if planning_attempts > 1:
        # Re-plan the workflow
        workflow = replan_workflow(...)
        # Reset all agent states
        for agent in agents:
            agent.reset()
    
    # Run the inner loop for execution
    inner_loop_result = run_inner_loop(workflow)
    
    # Evaluate if we need another planning attempt
    if not should_replan(workflow, ...):
        break
```

#### Inner Loop (Execution Loop)

The Inner Loop handles:
- Managing the ProgressLedger
- Executing workflow steps in the proper sequence
- Tracking step completion status
- Monitoring for loops or lack of progress
- Evaluating step-level execution results

Implementation logic:
```python
# Pseudo-code for the inner loop
inner_loop_iterations = 0
while inner_loop_iterations < max_inner_loop_iterations:
    inner_loop_iterations += 1
    
    # Check if workflow is complete
    if workflow_is_complete():
        break
    
    # Check for looping behavior
    if inner_loop_iterations > len(workflow) * 2:
        break
    
    # Get steps ready for execution
    ready_steps = get_ready_steps()
    
    # Execute ready steps
    for step in ready_steps:
        result = execute_step(step)
        process_result(result)
    
    # Check for progress
    progress = calculate_progress()
    if progress < reflection_threshold:
        break  # Break to outer loop for replanning
```

### Error Recovery Mechanisms

The Orchestrator implements several error recovery mechanisms:

1. **Step-Level Retry**: Individual steps can be retried up to a configurable maximum
2. **Plan Revision**: The entire plan can be revised if too many steps fail
3. **Alternative Approaches**: Failed steps can be replaced with alternative implementations
4. **Progress Evaluation**: Detecting insufficient progress triggers replanning
5. **Critical Path Analysis**: Identifying and prioritizing critical steps

The criteria for replanning include:
- Critical step failures
- Excessive failure rate (>25% of steps)
- Insufficient progress (below reflection threshold)
- Deadlock detection (no steps ready, but workflow incomplete)

### Progress Monitoring

The Orchestrator continuously monitors execution progress:

```python
def _calculate_progress(workflow, completed_steps, failed_steps):
    # Weight completed steps fully, failed steps partially
    weighted_completed = len(completed_steps) + (len(failed_steps) * 0.25)
    return weighted_completed / len(workflow)
```

### Task Delegation

The Orchestrator delegates tasks to specialized agents based on their capabilities:

1. **Agent Type Matching**: Tasks specify the required agent type
2. **Parameter Passing**: Task parameters are passed to the appropriate agent
3. **Result Collection**: Results from agent execution are collected and stored
4. **Dynamic Agent Selection**: The most appropriate agent is selected at runtime

## Workflow Example

A typical workflow execution follows these steps:

1. User submits a complex task to the system
2. AgentSystem recognizes it as a complex task needing orchestration
3. Orchestrator creates a dynamic workflow plan
4. Outer loop initiates plan execution
5. Inner loop executes individual steps
6. Steps are assigned to specialized agents (WebSurfer, FileSurfer, etc.)
7. Results are collected and progress is monitored
8. If issues occur, the plan is revised
9. Final results are returned to the user

## Integration with Chainlit

The Chainlit integration provides:

- **Message Handling**: Processing user messages through the agent system
- **Task Visualization**: Displaying tasks and their status
- **Step Visualization**: Showing the steps of complex workflows
- **Stream Processing**: Streaming responses for immediate feedback
- **Automatic Orchestration Detection**: Identifying complex tasks that benefit from orchestration

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Results are cached to avoid redundant computation
- **Async Execution**: Non-dependent tasks can execute concurrently
- **Resource Management**: Metrics track resource usage during execution
- **Reflection Thresholds**: Configurable thresholds for replanning
- **Maximum Iterations**: Limits on planning attempts and execution iterations

## Security Considerations

- **Agent Isolation**: Agents operate with limited permissions
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Controlled Execution**: Agents can only execute predefined actions
- **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged in the ledgers
