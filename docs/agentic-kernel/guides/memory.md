# Memory in AgenticKernel

AgenticKernel provides flexible memory management for agents, supporting both short-term and long-term memory modules.
This guide covers core memory concepts and configuration options.

## Types of Memory

- **Short-term memory:** For immediate task context and working memory.
- **Long-term memory:** Persistent, extensible storage for agent knowledge.

## Customizing Memory

- Configure memory modules via agent configuration options.
- Extend memory with plugins for new storage backends or retrieval strategies.
