## Communication Patterns

AgenticKernel implements several communication patterns for effective agent collaboration:

### Point-to-Point Communication

Direct communication between two agents, typically used for specific queries or responses:

```
Agent A → Agent B: Direct request or information transfer
Agent B → Agent A: Direct response or acknowledgment
```

### Broadcast Communication
