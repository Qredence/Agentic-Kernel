# AgenticKernel Concepts

AgenticKernel is built around several core concepts that enable flexible and powerful AI agent systems.

## Core Concepts

### Agents

Autonomous entities capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within an environment. Agents can communicate,
collaborate, and delegate tasks.

### Tasks

Discrete units of work that agents can execute, delegate, or decompose. Managed by the TaskManager.

### Memory

Short-term and long-term memory modules for agents, enabling context retention and learning.

### Communication (A2A Protocol)

Support for the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling discovery, messaging, and collaboration between agents via
HTTP/JSON-RPC 2.0.

### Plugins & Extensions

Extend agent capabilities via plugins for tools, integrations, and new behaviors.

### Orchestration

Coordinating multi-agent workflows, task decomposition, and lifecycle management.
