# AgenticKernel Introduction

AgenticKernel is a modular, extensible platform for building, orchestrating, and running AI agents. It provides a robust
foundation for agent communication, task management, memory, and interoperability (including A2A protocol support).

## What is AgenticKernel?

AgenticKernel is the core engine for agent-based systems, powering agent-to-agent (A2A) communication, task
decomposition, and multi-agent workflows. It is designed for flexibility, composability, and integration with broader
agentic ecosystems (such as AgenticFleet).

## Key Features

- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol support
- Modular agent architecture
- Task management and orchestration
- Extensible memory and plugin systems
- Integration-ready for fleet-scale agent management (AgenticFleet)

## Relationship to AgenticFleet

AgenticKernel is the foundation for single or small groups of agents. AgenticFleet builds on top of AgenticKernel to
provide large-scale agent management, deployment, and monitoring.
