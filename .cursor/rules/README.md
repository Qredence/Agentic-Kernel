# Cursor Rules Directory

This directory contains the coding and development rules for the AgenticFleet-Labs project. The rules are organized into separate files for better maintainability and clarity.

## Structure

- `chainlit.rules.md`: Guidelines for ChainLit integration and UI development
- `development.rules.md`: General development practices and project standards

## Usage

These rules are automatically applied by Cursor when working with the codebase. They help maintain consistency and best practices across the project.

## Updating Rules

When updating these rules:
1. Make changes in the appropriate rule file
2. Update the README if new rule categories are added
3. Ensure changes align with project goals
4. Test that Cursor correctly applies the new rules

## Environment Configuration

Global configurations are stored in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`. Environment-specific settings should be managed through environment variables.
