# Cursor Rules Directory

This directory contains the development rules and guidelines for the AgenticFleet project. The rules are organized into focused, single-responsibility files using MDC (Markdown Configuration) format.

## Rule Files

```rules
files:
  structure.rules.mdc: "Project structure and file organization"
  style.rules.mdc: "Code style and formatting"
  testing.rules.mdc: "Testing requirements and patterns"
  llm.rules.mdc: "LLM integration and configuration"
  plugins.rules.mdc: "Plugin development guidelines"
  agents.rules.mdc: "Agent development guidelines"
  security.rules.mdc: "Security requirements and practices"
  git.rules.mdc: "Version control and Git workflow"
```

## MDC Format

Each rule file follows the MDC format which combines markdown with structured configuration blocks:

```rules
example:
  section:
    key: value
    list:
      - item1: value1
      - item2: value2
```

## Rule Structure

Each rule file:
- Contains a single aspect of development
- Is limited to 50 lines
- Uses clear, hierarchical organization
- Includes descriptive comments
- Follows consistent formatting

## Enforcement

Rules are enforced through:
```rules
enforcement:
  tools:
    - cursor: "IDE configuration"
    - pre-commit: "Git hooks"
    - ci: "Pipeline checks"
    
  process:
    - reviews: "Code review checklist"
    - automation: "Automated checks"
    - documentation: "Living documentation"
```
